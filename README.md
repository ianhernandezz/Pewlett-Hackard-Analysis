# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


**Explain the Purpose of this Analysis.**

The purpose of this analysis was to take the information that was just created and use it to devlope the information that is being asked from the manager. The information that has been requested is; 

1. Determine the number of retiring employees per title
2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

Then we must provide an analysis of what this information beign presented means.

**Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.**

* It can be determined that there is a high level of people that can retire. 
* Based on the previous point, this means that there is a high amount of people that are in the older category of the spectrum.
* (57,668/90,398) = 64%. So out of the 90,398, a solid percentage are the population is exiting. 
* The mentorship program is a great aspectec of this, unfortunatly a small number of that population that is exiting qualifies for it.
